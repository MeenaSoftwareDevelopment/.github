# Meena Software Development

## Chosen Project

**Pairs** - Rows of hidden items (often playing cards) will be selected by the player then matched with other hidden items. Players gain points by
finding matched pairs. If no pair is found both items are hidden again.

This project will be web-based, using React.

## Roles

Undecided as of now.

## Project Activities


### Activity 1 Group Guidance – Requirements/Creative Session

1. Review all available projects before deciding which to develop - PAIRS

2. Consider your primary target audience (see Possible Project Target Demographics) - Epic Gamers  

3. Create an overall specification based on user and system requirements (including HCI, game/application-rules and the game/application-
mechanics (e.g. what are the rules for the game, how will the game be controlled, how will any non-player characters interact, etc.) - The game has to include a even ammount of objects/card, when clicked the cards will reveal itself and if 2 of them match the player gets a point and then turn around. 
 
5. Create two different user profiles (based on your selected target type) – these profiles should include basic details regarding individual’s
wants and needs associated with the game : Possible target audience: Primary school children playing in school, elderly people who are trying to excercise their memory, adult beginner gamblers. 

7. Determine the project’s high-level ‘functional specifications’ (e.g. what are the hardware requirements, operating system environment,
application functions, collisions, AI, scores, timers, etc.)
Possible advanced features: if user gets it wrong, they turn around and shuffle OR if they user gets 3 correct in a row, they get double/more points. Users might have a timer for each round which decreases to make the game harder. 

9. Determine the project’s high-level ‘non-functional’ specifications (aesthetic, usability, ease of use, feedback style, basic needs, etc.)
10. Create mock-ups for the overall look, user interface design, dialogue windows and input mechanisms, etc
11. Construct basic storyboards associated with the game-play/app use
12. Identify and rank potential risks to the project’s success (such as: technical knowledge, coding, testing, scope, dependencies) – this should
not include time management
13. Identify and establish your software development strategy
14. Define an overall test plan (this will be used later and may be repeated several times to ensure the project is successful)
