# Meena Software Development

## Chosen Project

**Pairs** - Rows of hidden items (often playing cards) will be selected by the player then matched with other hidden items. Players gain points by
finding matched pairs. If no pair is found both items are hidden again.

This project will be web-based, using React.

## Roles

Undecided as of now.

Project Activities
Activity 1 Group Guidance – Requirements/Creative Session
1. Review all available projects before deciding which to develop - PAIRS
2. Consider your primary target audience (see Possible Project Target Demographics) 
3. Create an overall specification based on user and system requirements (including HCI, game/application-rules and the game/application-
mechanics (e.g. what are the rules for the game, how will the game be controlled, how will any non-player characters interact, etc.)
4. Create two different user profiles (based on your selected target type) – these profiles should include basic details regarding individual’s
wants and needs associated with the game
5. Determine the project’s high-level ‘functional specifications’ (e.g. what are the hardware requirements, operating system environment,
application functions, collisions, AI, scores, timers, etc.)
6. Determine the project’s high-level ‘non-functional’ specifications (aesthetic, usability, ease of use, feedback style, basic needs, etc.)
7. Create mock-ups for the overall look, user interface design, dialogue windows and input mechanisms, etc
8. Construct basic storyboards associated with the game-play/app use
9. Identify and rank potential risks to the project’s success (such as: technical knowledge, coding, testing, scope, dependencies) – this should
not include time management
10. Identify and establish your software development strategy
11. Define an overall test plan (this will be used later and may be repeated several times to ensure the project is successful)
