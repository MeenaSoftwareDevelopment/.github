# Meena Software Development

## Project Details

### Chosen Project

**Pairs** - Rows of hidden items (often playing cards) will be selected by the player then matched with other hidden items. Players gain points by
finding matched pairs. If no pair is found both items are hidden again.

This project will be web-based, using React.

### Target Demographic

The main target demographic will be **Epic Gamers**.

### Gameplay

The game has to include a even amount of objects/cards. When clicked, the chosen card will reveal itself, and if 2 of them match, the player gets a point, if not they turn around again and shuffle.

If 3 cards match, the player will get a special point.

### Target Platform

The game will be developed using React, so the target platform is any modern browser.

OSes include Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, ChromeOS, pretty much anything that will run a modern browser and that supports React.

## Roles

Undecided as of now.

## Project Activities

### Activity 1 Group Guidance – Requirements/Creative Session

1. Review all available projects before deciding which to develop - PAIRS

2. Consider your primary target audience (see Possible Project Target Demographics) - Epic Gamers  

3. Create an overall specification based on user and system requirements (including HCI, game/application-rules and the game/application-
mechanics (e.g. what are the rules for the game, how will the game be controlled, how will any non-player characters interact, etc.) - The game has to include a even ammount of objects/card, when clicked the cards will reveal itself and if 2 of them match the player gets a point and then turn around. Possible advanced features: if user gets it wrong, they turn around and shuffle OR if they user gets 3 correct in a row, they get double/more points. 
 
5. Create two different user profiles (based on your selected target type) – these profiles should include basic details regarding individual’s
wants and needs associated with the game : Possible target audience: Primary school children playing in school, elderly people who are trying to excercise their memory, adult beginner gamblers. 

7. Determine the project’s high-level ‘functional specifications’ (e.g. what are the hardware requirements, operating system environment,
application functions, collisions, AI, scores, timers, etc.)
8. Determine the project’s high-level ‘non-functional’ specifications (aesthetic, usability, ease of use, feedback style, basic needs, etc.)
9. Create mock-ups for the overall look, user interface design, dialogue windows and input mechanisms, etc
10. Construct basic storyboards associated with the game-play/app use
11. Identify and rank potential risks to the project’s success (such as: technical knowledge, coding, testing, scope, dependencies) – this should
not include time management
12. Identify and establish your software development strategy
13. Define an overall test plan (this will be used later and may be repeated several times to ensure the project is successful)
